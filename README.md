#NodeCrud- A movie review application.

This project requires that you have a mysql database called nodecrud with a table called movie_reviews.
The table should contain fields for id(primary key of type int) movieName (string) and movieReview(string).
It uses an exress js server to connect to the db.
The client has a submission box and lists the movies and their reviews.
